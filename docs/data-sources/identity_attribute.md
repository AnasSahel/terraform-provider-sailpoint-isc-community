# sailpoint_identity_attribute (Data Source)

Use this data source to retrieve detailed information about a specific SailPoint Identity Attribute. Identity attributes are configurable fields on identity objects. See [Identity Attributes API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/list-identity-attributes/) for more information.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The technical name of the identity attribute. This is used as the identifier and is immutable after creation.

### Read-Only

- `display_name` (String) The user-friendly display name of the identity attribute shown in the UI.
- `multi` (Boolean) Indicates whether this attribute can hold multiple values. Must be set to `false` to make the attribute searchable. Defaults to `false`.
- `searchable` (Boolean) Indicates whether this attribute can be used in searches. Can only be `true` if `system`, `standard`, and `multi` are all `false`. Defaults to `false`.
- `sources` (Attributes List) List of sources that define how the identity attribute is populated. **Note:** This field is marked as required by this provider to enforce explicit configuration, even though the SailPoint API allows creating attributes without specifying sources. This is a provider design decision to promote infrastructure-as-code best practices. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--sources))
- `standard` (Boolean) Indicates whether this is a standard attribute. Standard attributes cannot be deleted. Must be set to `false` to make the attribute searchable or deletable. Defaults to `false`.
- `system` (Boolean) Indicates whether this is a system-managed attribute. System attributes cannot be deleted. Must be set to `false` to make the attribute searchable or deletable. Defaults to `false`.
- `type` (String) The data type of the identity attribute (e.g., `string`, `int`, `date`).

### Nested Schema for `sources`

Read-Only:

- `properties` (String) Configuration properties for the source as a JSON string. The structure varies by source type.
- `type` (String) The type of the source (e.g., `rule`, `static`).
