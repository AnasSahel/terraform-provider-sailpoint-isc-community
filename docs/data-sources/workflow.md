- `name` (String) Name of the workflow as it appears in the UI.
- `owner` (Attributes) Owner of the workflow. Must be a valid identity reference with `type` (typically 'IDENTITY'), `id` (UUID), and optionally `name`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owner))
- `trigger` (Attributes) Trigger configuration defining what initiates the workflow. Must include `type` (e.g., EVENT, SCHEDULED, REQUEST_RESPONSE) and optional `attributes` (trigger-specific configuration as JSON string). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--trigger))
