# sailpoint_workflow (Data Source)

Use this data source to retrieve detailed information about a specific SailPoint Workflow. Workflows are custom automation scripts that respond to event triggers. See [Workflow Documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/workflows/) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: Read an existing workflow by ID
data "sailpoint_workflow" "existing_workflow" {
  id = "00000000000000000000000000000001"
}

# Use the workflow data
output "workflow_name" {
  value = data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.name
}

output "workflow_enabled" {
  value = data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.enabled
}

output "workflow_owner" {
  value = data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.owner
}

output "workflow_trigger_type" {
  value = data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.trigger.type
}

# Example: Use workflow data in another resource
resource "sailpoint_workflow" "cloned_workflow" {
  name        = "${data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.name} - Copy"
  description = "Cloned from ${data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.name}"
  enabled     = false

  owner      = data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.owner
  trigger    = data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.trigger
  definition = data.sailpoint_workflow.existing_workflow.definition
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Unique identifier (UUID) of the workflow.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) ISO-8601 timestamp when the workflow was created (computed).
- `definition` (Attributes) Workflow definition containing the workflow logic. Must include `start` (name of first step to execute) and `steps` (JSON string with all workflow steps and their configurations). (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--definition))
- `description` (String) Description of the workflow's purpose and functionality.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the workflow is enabled (true) or disabled (false). Disabled workflows do not execute when triggered. Note: Workflows must be disabled before they can be deleted.
- `modified` (String) ISO-8601 timestamp when the workflow was last modified (computed).
- `name` (String) Name of the workflow as it appears in the UI.
- `owner` (Attributes) Owner of the workflow. Must be a valid identity reference with `type` (typically 'IDENTITY'), `id` (UUID), and optionally `name`. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owner))
- `trigger` (String) Trigger configuration defining what initiates the workflow. This is a computed field managed by the `sailpoint_workflow_trigger` resource. Do not configure this directly in the workflow resource.

<a id="nestedatt--definition"></a>
### Nested Schema for `definition`

Read-Only:

- `start` (String) The name of the first step to execute in the workflow.
- `steps` (String) Workflow steps as a JSON string. Each step defines an action or operator with its configuration.


<a id="nestedatt--owner"></a>
### Nested Schema for `owner`

Read-Only:

- `id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) of the owner identity.
- `name` (String) The name of the owner identity.
- `type` (String) The type of the referenced object (e.g., IDENTITY).
