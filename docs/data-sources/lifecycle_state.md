# sailpoint_lifecycle_state (Data Source)

Use this data source to retrieve information about a specific lifecycle state within an identity profile in SailPoint Identity Security Cloud (ISC). Lifecycle states define stages in an identity's lifecycle and control access provisioning and deprovisioning.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the lifecycle state to retrieve. This is a system-generated UUID that uniquely identifies the lifecycle state within the identity profile.
- `identity_profile_id` (String) The unique identifier of the identity profile that contains this lifecycle state. Identity profiles define how identities are processed and managed in SailPoint ISC.

### Read-Only

- `access_action_configuration` (Attributes) Configuration that determines what access management actions should be taken when identities transition into this lifecycle state. This includes options for automatically removing access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_action_configuration))
- `access_profile_ids` (List of String) A list of access profile IDs that are automatically granted to identities when they enter this lifecycle state. Access profiles bundle together related entitlements and roles.
- `account_actions` (Attributes List) A list of account management actions that will be executed when identities transition into this lifecycle state. These actions can include enabling, disabling, or unlocking accounts on specific sources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account_actions))
- `created` (String) The timestamp when this lifecycle state was created in SailPoint ISC, in ISO 8601 format.
- `description` (String) A detailed description of the lifecycle state, explaining its purpose and when it should be used in the identity lifecycle management process.
- `email_notification_option` (Attributes) Configuration for email notifications that are sent when identities enter this lifecycle state. This includes settings for notifying managers, admins, and specific users. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--email_notification_option))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating whether this lifecycle state is currently enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`). Disabled lifecycle states are not active and won't be applied to identities.
- `identity_count` (Number) The current number of identities that are assigned to this lifecycle state. This provides insight into how many users are currently in this stage of their lifecycle.
- `identity_state` (String) The identity state associated with this lifecycle state. This field controls the identity's overall status in the system and is typically `null` for most lifecycle states.
- `modified` (String) The timestamp when this lifecycle state was last modified in SailPoint ISC, in ISO 8601 format.
- `name` (String) The human-readable display name of the lifecycle state, such as 'Active', 'Inactive', 'Terminated', etc.
- `priority` (Number) The priority level of this lifecycle state, used to determine precedence when an identity exists in multiple identity profiles. Lower numeric values indicate higher priority (e.g., priority `1` takes precedence over priority `10`). This affects which lifecycle state's access profiles and rules are applied during provisioning operations.
- `technical_name` (String) The technical/internal name of the lifecycle state, used for system identification and API operations. This is typically a machine-readable identifier.

### Nested Schema for `access_action_configuration`

Read-Only:

- `remove_all_access_enabled` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if all access profiles, entitlements, and roles should be automatically removed when identities transition into this lifecycle state. This is typically used for termination or suspension lifecycle states.


<a id="nestedatt--account_actions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `account_actions`

Read-Only:

- `action` (String) The type of account action to perform when identities transition into this lifecycle state. Common values include 'ENABLE', 'DISABLE', 'UNLOCK', etc.
- `all_sources` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if this account action should be applied to all available sources for the identity, rather than just the sources specified in `source_ids`.
- `exclude_source_ids` (List of String) A list of source identifiers that should be excluded from this account action, even if they match other selection criteria.
- `source_ids` (List of String) A list of source identifiers where this account action should be executed. If `all_sources` is true, this field is typically empty.


<a id="nestedatt--email_notification_option"></a>
### Nested Schema for `email_notification_option`

Read-Only:

- `email_address_list` (List of String) A list of email addresses that will receive notifications when identities transition into this lifecycle state. This is only used when `notify_specific_users` is set to `true`.
- `notify_all_admins` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if all system administrators should be notified via email when identities transition into this lifecycle state.
- `notify_managers` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if the managers of identities should be notified via email when identities transition into this lifecycle state.
- `notify_specific_users` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if specific users (defined in `email_address_list`) should be notified via email when identities transition into this lifecycle state.
