# sailpoint_lifecycle_state (Data Source)

Use this data source to retrieve detailed information about a specific SailPoint Lifecycle State within an Identity Profile. Lifecycle States define the stages an identity goes through, such as joiner, mover, or leaver states. See [Lifecycle State Documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2024/get-lifecycle-state) for more information.

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) Unique identifier (UUID) of the lifecycle state.
- `identity_profile_id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) of the identity profile that this lifecycle state belongs to. **Changing this forces recreation of the resource.**

### Read-Only

- `access_action_configuration` (Attributes) Configuration for access-related actions to perform when entering this lifecycle state, such as removing all access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_action_configuration))
- `access_profile_ids` (List of String) List of access profile IDs (UUIDs) to automatically grant to identities when they enter this lifecycle state.
- `account_actions` (Attributes List) List of account actions to perform on identity accounts when entering this lifecycle state. Actions include ENABLE, DISABLE, or DELETE, and can target specific sources or all sources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account_actions))
- `created` (String) ISO-8601 timestamp when the lifecycle state was created (computed, read-only).
- `description` (String) Optional description explaining the purpose and behavior of this lifecycle state.
- `email_notification_option` (Attributes) Configuration for email notifications to send when an identity enters this lifecycle state. Allows notifying managers, administrators, or specific email addresses. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--email_notification_option))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the lifecycle state is enabled (true) or disabled (false). When disabled, identities cannot enter this lifecycle state. Defaults to `false` if not specified.
- `identity_count` (Number) The number of identities currently in this lifecycle state (computed, read-only).
- `identity_state` (String) The identity state classification. Valid values are `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE_SHORT_TERM`, or `INACTIVE_LONG_TERM`. This determines how the identity's access is managed.
- `modified` (String) ISO-8601 timestamp when the lifecycle state was last modified (computed, read-only).
- `name` (String) The display name of the lifecycle state as it appears in the UI.
- `priority` (Number) Priority order for the lifecycle state. Lower numbers have higher priority. This determines the order in which lifecycle states are evaluated.
- `technical_name` (String) The technical name used for referencing the lifecycle state programmatically. Must be unique within the identity profile. **Changing this forces recreation of the resource.**
