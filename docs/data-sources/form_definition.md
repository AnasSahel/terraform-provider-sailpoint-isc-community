# sailpoint_form_definition (Data Source)

Data source for SailPoint Form Definition. Forms are used to collect data in access requests and workflows.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# SailPoint Form Definition Data Source Example
#
# This data source allows you to retrieve information about an existing
# SailPoint form definition by its ID.

# Example: Read an existing form definition
data "sailpoint_form_definition" "existing_form" {
  id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}

# You can then reference the form definition attributes
output "form_name" {
  value = data.sailpoint_form_definition.existing_form.name
}

output "form_description" {
  value = data.sailpoint_form_definition.existing_form.description
}

output "form_owner" {
  value = data.sailpoint_form_definition.existing_form.owner
}

output "form_elements" {
  value = data.sailpoint_form_definition.existing_form.form_elements
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the form definition.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) The date and time when the form definition was created.

- `form_input` (Attributes List) List of form inputs that can be passed into the form for use in conditional logic. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--form_input))
- `modified` (String) The date and time when the form definition was last modified.
- `name` (String) The name of the form definition.
- `owner` (Attributes) The owner of the form definition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owner))
- `used_by` (Attributes List) List of objects that use this form definition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--used_by))
