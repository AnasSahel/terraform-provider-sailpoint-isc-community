## Schema

### Required

- `connector` (String) The connector type identifier (e.g., 'active-directory', 'workday', 'delimited-file').
- `description` (String) A human-readable description of the source and its purpose.
- `name` (String) The display name for the source. Must be unique within the organization.
- `owner` (String) The owner of the source. Must be a JSON string containing `id`, `type` (typically 'IDENTITY'), and `name` fields.

### Optional

- `account_correlation_config` (String) Account correlation configuration reference. Must be a JSON string containing `id`, `name`, and `type` (typically 'ACCOUNT_CORRELATION_CONFIG') fields.
- `account_correlation_rule` (String) Account correlation rule reference. Must be a JSON string containing `id`, `name`, and `type` (typically 'RULE') fields.
- `authoritative` (Boolean) When true, indicates that the source is referenced by an identity profile and is authoritative for identity data.
- `before_provisioning_rule` (String) Before provisioning rule reference. Must be a JSON string containing `id`, `name`, and `type` (typically 'RULE') fields.

- `connector_attributes` (String, Sensitive) Connector-specific configuration. Must be a JSON string containing the configuration parameters required by the specific connector type. This field is marked as sensitive as it may contain credentials.
- `connector_class` (String) Fully qualified name of the Java class that implements the connector interface.
- `credential_provider_enabled` (Boolean) If true, enables a credential provider for the source. When enabled, the source can use credential provider(s) to fetch credentials.
- `delete_threshold` (Number) Number from 0 to 100 that specifies when to skip the delete phase during aggregation.

- `connector_id` (String) Connector implementation ID used internally by SailPoint.
- `connector_name` (String) Name of the connector that was chosen during source creation.
- `created` (String) Date-time when the source was created, in RFC3339 format.
- `healthy` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating whether the source is currently healthy and operational.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier for the source. This is automatically generated by SailPoint.
- `modified` (String) Date-time when the source was last modified, in RFC3339 format.
- `schemas` (String) List of references to schema objects associated with this source, returned as a JSON string.
- `since` (String) Timestamp that shows when a source health check was last performed.
