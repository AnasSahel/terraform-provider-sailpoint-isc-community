- `description` (String) The description of the workflow.
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the workflow is enabled. Workflows cannot be created in an enabled state. Defaults to `false`.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) The date and time the workflow was created.
- `creator` (Attributes) The identity who created the workflow. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--creator))
- `execution_count` (Number) The number of times the workflow has been executed.
- `failure_count` (Number) The number of times the workflow has failed.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the workflow.
- `modified` (String) The date and time the workflow was last modified.
- `modified_by` (Attributes) The identity who last modified the workflow. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--modified_by))
