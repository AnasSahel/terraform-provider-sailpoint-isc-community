# sailpoint_access_profile (Resource)

Manages a SailPoint Access Profile. Access Profiles are collections of entitlements from a source that can be requested by users. See [Access Profile Documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/create-access-profile) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
