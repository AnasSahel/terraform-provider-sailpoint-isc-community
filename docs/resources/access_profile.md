# sailpoint_access_profile (Resource)

Manages a SailPoint Access Profile. Access Profiles are collections of entitlements from a source that can be requested by users. See [Access Profile Documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/create-access-profile) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example 1: Basic Access Profile
# Minimal configuration with required fields only
resource "sailpoint_access_profile" "basic" {
  name        = "Basic Employee Access"
  description = "Standard access for all employees"

  # Owner must be an identity with ROLE_SUBADMIN or SOURCE_SUBADMIN authority
  owner = {
    type = "IDENTITY"
    id   = "00000000000000000000000000000001"

  # Source determines which entitlements are available

## Schema

### Required

- `entitlements` (Attributes List) **Required.** List of entitlement references included in this access profile. At least one entitlement must be specified.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash

# Import an existing SailPoint Access Profile into Terraform state
# The import ID is the access profile's UUID from SailPoint ISC

# Basic import command
terraform import sailpoint_access_profile.example "00000000000000000000000000000001"

# Import with specific resource name
terraform import sailpoint_access_profile.my_profile "00000000000000000000000000000002"

# Steps to find the access profile ID:
# 1. Via UI: Navigate to Access Profiles, select the profile, and copy the ID from the URL
# 2. Via API: Use the List Access Profiles endpoint
#    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
#         "https://{tenant}.api.identitynow.com/v2025/access-profiles?filters=name eq \"Profile Name\""
# 3. Via ISC CLI: Use the SailPoint CLI to list access profiles
#    sail access-profile list --name "Profile Name"
```
