# sailpoint_lifecycle_state (Resource)

Manages a SailPoint Lifecycle State within an Identity Profile. Lifecycle states define different stages in an identity's lifecycle (e.g., onboarding, active, termination) and associated actions. See [Lifecycle State Documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/lifecycle-states/) for more information.

## Schema

### Required

- `identity_profile_id` (String) The unique identifier (UUID) of the identity profile that this lifecycle state belongs to. **Changing this forces recreation of the resource.**
- `name` (String) The display name of the lifecycle state as it appears in the UI.
- `technical_name` (String) The technical name used for referencing the lifecycle state programmatically. Must be unique within the identity profile. **Changing this forces recreation of the resource.**

### Optional

- `access_action_configuration` (Attributes) Configuration for access-related actions to perform when entering this lifecycle state, such as removing all access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_action_configuration))
- `access_profile_ids` (List of String) List of access profile IDs (UUIDs) to automatically grant to identities when they enter this lifecycle state.
- `account_actions` (Attributes List) List of account actions to perform on identity accounts when entering this lifecycle state. Actions include ENABLE, DISABLE, or DELETE, and can target specific sources or all sources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account_actions))
- `description` (String) Optional description explaining the purpose and behavior of this lifecycle state.
- `email_notification_option` (Attributes) Configuration for email notifications to send when an identity enters this lifecycle state. Allows notifying managers, administrators, or specific email addresses. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--email_notification_option))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Whether the lifecycle state is enabled (true) or disabled (false). When disabled, identities cannot enter this lifecycle state. Defaults to `false` if not specified.
- `identity_state` (String) The identity state classification. Valid values are `ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE_SHORT_TERM`, or `INACTIVE_LONG_TERM`. This determines how the identity's access is managed.
- `priority` (Number) Priority order for the lifecycle state. Lower numbers have higher priority. This determines the order in which lifecycle states are evaluated.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) ISO-8601 timestamp when the lifecycle state was created (computed, read-only).
- `id` (String) Unique identifier (UUID) of the lifecycle state.
- `identity_count` (Number) The number of identities currently in this lifecycle state (computed, read-only).
- `modified` (String) ISO-8601 timestamp when the lifecycle state was last modified (computed, read-only).
