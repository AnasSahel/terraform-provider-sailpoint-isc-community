Lifecycle State resource schema



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `identity_profile_id` (String) The unique identifier of the identity profile that contains this lifecycle state. Identity profiles define how identities are processed and managed in SailPoint ISC.
- `name` (String) The human-readable display name of the lifecycle state, such as 'Active', 'Inactive', 'Terminated', etc.
- `technical_name` (String) The technical/internal name of the lifecycle state, used for system identification and API operations. This is typically a machine-readable identifier.

### Optional

- `access_action_configuration` (Attributes) Configuration that determines what access management actions should be taken when identities transition into this lifecycle state. This includes options for automatically removing access. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--access_action_configuration))
- `access_profile_ids` (List of String) A list of unique identifiers for access profiles that are linked to this lifecycle state. Access profiles define sets of entitlements and permissions granted to identities in this state.
- `account_actions` (Attributes List) A list of account management actions that will be executed when identities transition into this lifecycle state. These actions can include enabling, disabling, or unlocking accounts on specific sources. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--account_actions))
- `description` (String) A detailed description of the lifecycle state, providing context about its purpose and usage within identity management processes.
- `email_notification_option` (Attributes) Configuration for email notifications that are sent when identities enter this lifecycle state. This includes settings for notifying managers, admins, and specific users. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--email_notification_option))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating whether this lifecycle state is currently enabled (`true`) or disabled (`false`). Disabled lifecycle states are not active and won't be applied to identities.
- `identity_state` (String) The broader identity state (e.g., 'Active', 'Inactive', 'Terminated') that this lifecycle state maps to within the identity management framework.
- `priority` (Number) An integer value representing the priority of this lifecycle state relative to other states in the same identity profile. Lower numbers indicate higher priority.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) The timestamp when this lifecycle state was created in SailPoint ISC, in ISO 8601 format.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the lifecycle state. This is a system-generated UUID that uniquely identifies the lifecycle state within SailPoint Identity Security Cloud (ISC).
- `identity_count` (Number) The count of identities that are currently assigned to this lifecycle state within the associated identity profile.
- `modified` (String) The timestamp when this lifecycle state was last modified in SailPoint ISC, in ISO 8601 format.

### Nested Schema for `access_action_configuration`

Optional:

- `remove_all_access_enabled` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if all access profiles, entitlements, and roles should be automatically removed when identities transition into this lifecycle state. This is typically used for termination or suspension lifecycle states.


<a id="nestedatt--account_actions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `account_actions`

Required:

- `action` (String) The type of account action to perform when identities transition into this lifecycle state. Common values include 'ENABLE', 'DISABLE', 'UNLOCK', etc.

Optional:

- `all_sources` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if this account action should be applied to all available sources for the identity, rather than just the sources specified in `source_ids`.
- `exclude_source_ids` (List of String) A list of source identifiers that should be excluded from this account action, even if they match other selection criteria.
- `source_ids` (List of String) A list of source identifiers where this account action should be executed. If `all_sources` is true, this field is typically empty.


<a id="nestedatt--email_notification_option"></a>
### Nested Schema for `email_notification_option`

Optional:

- `email_address_list` (List of String) A list of email addresses that will receive notifications when identities transition into this lifecycle state. This is only used when `notify_specific_users` is set to `true`.
- `notify_all_admins` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if all system administrators should be notified via email when identities transition into this lifecycle state.
- `notify_managers` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if the managers of identities should be notified via email when identities transition into this lifecycle state.
- `notify_specific_users` (Boolean) Boolean flag indicating if specific users (defined in `email_address_list`) should be notified via email when identities transition into this lifecycle state.
