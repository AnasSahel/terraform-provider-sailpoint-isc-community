- `name` (String) Name of the transform as it appears in the UI. This field is immutable after creation.
- `type` (String) Type of the transform operation (e.g., `lower`, `upper`, `lookup`, `static`). This field is immutable after creation. See [Transform Operations](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/extensibility/transforms/operations) for available types.

### Read-Only

- `id` (String) Unique identifier (UUID) of the transform.
- `internal` (Boolean) Indicates whether this is an internal SailPoint transform (true) or a custom transform (false). Only SailPoint employees can create internal transforms.
