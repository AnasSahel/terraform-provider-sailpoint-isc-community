# sailpoint_identity_profile (Resource)

Manages a SailPoint Identity Profile. Identity profiles define configurations for identities including authoritative sources and attribute mappings. See [Identity Profiles API](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/list-identity-profiles/) for more information.



<!-- schema generated by tfplugindocs -->
## Schema

### Required

- `authoritative_source` (Attributes) The authoritative source that provides the primary identity data for this profile. This is a required field. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--authoritative_source))
- `name` (String) The name of the identity profile. This is the human-readable name used to identify the profile.

### Optional

- `description` (String) A description of the identity profile providing additional context about its purpose and configuration.
- `has_time_based_attr` (Boolean) Indicates the value of `requiresPeriodicRefresh` attribute for the identity profile. Set to `true` if the profile includes time-based attributes that require periodic refresh. Defaults to `false`.
- `identity_attribute_config` (Attributes) Configuration that defines how identity attributes are mapped and transformed. This controls the attribute mapping process during identity refresh. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--identity_attribute_config))
- `identity_refresh_required` (Boolean) Set to `true` if an identity refresh is necessary. You would typically want to trigger an identity refresh when a change has been made on the source. Defaults to `false`.
- `owner` (Attributes) The owner of the identity profile. This is typically an identity that has administrative control over the profile. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owner))
- `priority` (Number) The priority of the identity profile. Lower numbers indicate higher priority. This affects which profile takes precedence when an identity matches multiple profiles.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) The timestamp when the identity profile was created (ISO 8601 format).
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the identity profile. This is a system-generated ID.
- `identity_count` (Number) The number of identities currently associated with this profile. This is a read-only computed value.
- `identity_exception_report_reference` (Attributes) Reference to an identity exception report if exceptions occurred during identity processing. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--identity_exception_report_reference))
- `modified` (String) The timestamp when the identity profile was last modified (ISO 8601 format).

<a id="nestedatt--authoritative_source"></a>
### Nested Schema for `authoritative_source`

Required:

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the authoritative source.
- `type` (String) The type of the authoritative source. Must be `SOURCE`.

Read-Only:

- `name` (String) The display name of the authoritative source.


<a id="nestedatt--identity_attribute_config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `identity_attribute_config`

Optional:

- `attribute_transforms` (Attributes List) List of transforms that define how to generate or collect data for each identity attribute during the identity refresh process. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--identity_attribute_config--attribute_transforms))
- `enabled` (Boolean) Backend will only promote values if the profile/mapping is enabled. Defaults to `false`.

<a id="nestedatt--identity_attribute_config--attribute_transforms"></a>
### Nested Schema for `identity_attribute_config.attribute_transforms`

Required:

- `identity_attribute_name` (String) The name of the identity attribute to which this transform applies (e.g., `email`, `department`).

Optional:

- `transform_definition` (String) The transform definition that specifies how the attribute value should be calculated or derived.



<a id="nestedatt--owner"></a>
### Nested Schema for `owner`

Required:

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the owner identity.
- `type` (String) The type of the owner object. Must be `IDENTITY`.

Read-Only:

- `name` (String) The display name of the owner identity.


<a id="nestedatt--identity_exception_report_reference"></a>
### Nested Schema for `identity_exception_report_reference`

Read-Only:

- `report_name` (String) The name of the exception report.
- `task_result_id` (String) The UUID of the task result that generated the exception report.
