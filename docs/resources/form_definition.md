# sailpoint_form_definition (Resource)

Manages a SailPoint Form Definition. Forms are composed of sections and fields for data collection in workflows. See [Custom Forms Documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/custom-forms/) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# SailPoint Form Definition Resource Examples
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - REQUIRED FIELDS: name, owner (with type and id), form_elements
# - Forms are composed of sections and fields for data collection
# - Form elements are now structured objects (not JSON strings)
# - Each form element MUST have an 'id' and 'element_type'
# - The 'config' field within elements uses jsonencode() for complex configurations
# - The 'owner' field references an identity who owns this form
#
# For more information, see:
# https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/custom-forms/

terraform import sailpoint_form_definition.basic_form "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
