# sailpoint_form_definition (Resource)

Resource for SailPoint Form Definition. Forms are used to collect data in access requests and workflows.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# SailPoint Form Definition Resource Examples
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - REQUIRED FIELDS: name, owner (with type and id), form_elements
# - Forms are composed of sections and fields for data collection
# - Form elements are now structured objects (not JSON strings)
# - Each form element MUST have an 'id' and 'element_type'
# - The 'config' field within elements uses jsonencode() for complex configurations
# - The 'owner' field references an identity who owns this form
#
# For more information, see:
# https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/custom-forms/

# Example 1: Basic Form with Single Section

  description = "Basic form to collect employee information"

  owner = {
    type = "IDENTITY"

  }

  form_elements = [
    {
      id           = "section1"
      element_type = "SECTION"
      config = jsonencode({

        formElements = [
          {

## Schema

### Required

- `name` (String) The name of the form definition.

### Optional

- `description` (String) The description of the form definition.

Each element object has: id, elementType (TEXT, TOGGLE, TEXTAREA, HIDDEN, PHONE, EMAIL, SELECT, DATE, SECTION, COLUMN_SET, IMAGE, DESCRIPTION), config, key, validations. **Important:** Omit fields with zero values (empty strings `""`, empty arrays `[]`, `false`) from the JSON to avoid inconsistent plan errors.
- `form_input` (Attributes List) List of form inputs that can be passed into the form for use in conditional logic. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--form_input))
- `used_by` (Attributes List) List of objects that use this form definition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--used_by))

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) The date and time when the form definition was created.
- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the form definition.
- `modified` (String) The date and time when the form definition was last modified.

<a id="nestedatt--form_conditions"></a>
### Nested Schema for `form_conditions`

Required:

- `rules` (Attributes List) List of rules for the condition. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--form_conditions--rules))

<a id="nestedatt--form_conditions--effects"></a>
### Nested Schema for `form_conditions.effects`

Required:

- `config` (Attributes) The configuration for the effect. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--form_conditions--effects--config))
- `effect_type` (String) The type of the effect (HIDE, SHOW, DISABLE, ENABLE, REQUIRE, OPTIONAL, SUBMIT_MESSAGE, SUBMIT_NOTIFICATION, SET_DEFAULT_VALUE).

<a id="nestedatt--form_conditions--effects--config"></a>
### Nested Schema for `form_conditions.effects.config`

Required:

- `element` (String) The element targeted by the effect.

Optional:

- `default_value_label` (String) The default value label for the effect.



<a id="nestedatt--form_conditions--rules"></a>
### Nested Schema for `form_conditions.rules`

Required:

### Nested Schema for `used_by`

Optional:

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the referencing object.
- `name` (String) The name of the referencing object.
- `type` (String) The type of the referencing object (WORKFLOW, SOURCE, MySailPoint).

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Import an existing form definition by its ID
terraform import sailpoint_form_definition.basic_form "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
