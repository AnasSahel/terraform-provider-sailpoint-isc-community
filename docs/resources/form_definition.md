# sailpoint_form_definition (Resource)

Manages a SailPoint Form Definition. Forms are composed of sections and fields for data collection in workflows. See [Custom Forms Documentation](https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/custom-forms/) for more information.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# SailPoint Form Definition Resource Examples
#
# IMPORTANT NOTES:
# - REQUIRED FIELDS: name, owner (with type and id), form_elements
# - Forms are composed of sections and fields for data collection
# - Form elements, inputs, and conditions are specified as JSON strings
# - Each form element MUST have an 'id' field
# - The 'owner' field references an identity who owns this form
#
# For more information, see:
# https://developer.sailpoint.com/docs/api/v2025/custom-forms/

# Example 1: Basic Form with Single Section and Text Field

  }

  form_elements = jsonencode([

      id          = "section1"
      elementType = "SECTION"
      config = {

- `name` (String) Name of the form as it appears in the UI.
- `owner` (Attributes) **Required.** Owner reference containing the identity who owns this form. Must include type (e.g., 'IDENTITY') and id fields. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--owner))

### Optional

- `description` (String) Description text that explains the purpose of this form.
- `form_conditions` (String) Form conditions configuration defining conditional logic that modifies the form dynamically, represented as a JSON string.

### Read-Only

- `created` (String) ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the form definition was created.
- `id` (String) Unique identifier (UUID) of the form definition.
- `modified` (String) ISO 8601 timestamp indicating when the form definition was last modified.
- `used_by` (Attributes List) List of object references showing which systems are using this form definition. Automatically tracked by the API when systems use the form. Each reference includes type, id, and name. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--used_by))

<a id="nestedatt--owner"></a>
### Nested Schema for `owner`

Required:

- `id` (String) The unique identifier of the referenced object.

## Import

Import is supported using the following syntax:

The [`terraform import` command](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/import) can be used, for example:

```shell
#!/bin/bash
# Import an existing form definition by its ID
terraform import sailpoint_form_definition.basic_form "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
```
