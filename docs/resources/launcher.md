## Example Usage

```terraform
# Example: Basic launcher for an interactive process
resource "sailpoint_launcher" "group_creation" {
  name        = "Group Creation Launcher"
  description = "Interactive launcher to create Active Directory groups"
  type        = "INTERACTIVE_PROCESS"
  disabled    = false

  reference = {
    type = "WORKFLOW"
    id   = "2c91808a7b5c3e1d017b5c4a8f6d0001"
  }

  config = jsonencode({
    label       = "Create AD Group"
    description = "Create a new Active Directory group with specified members"
    inputs = [
